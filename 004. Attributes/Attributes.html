<!-- Most of the HTML tags can also have attributes, which are extra bits of information.
An attribute is used to define the characteristics of an HTML element, and is placed inside the element's opening tag. 
All attributes are made up of two parts: a name and a value:
>> The name is the property you want to set. 
For example, the paragraph <p> element in the below example carries an attribute whose name is align,
    which you can use to indicate the alinment of paragraph on the page.
>> The value is what the value of the property to be set and always put within quotations.
The below example shows three possible values of align attribute: left, center and right. -->
