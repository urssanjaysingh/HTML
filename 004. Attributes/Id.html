<!-- The id attribute of an HTML tag can be used to uniquely identify any element within an HTML page.
There are two primary reasons that you might want to use an id attribute on an element:
>> If an element carries an id attribute as a unique identifier, it is possible to identify
    just that element and its content.
>> If you have elements of the same name within a Web page (or style sheet), you can use the id attribute
    to distinguish between elements that have the same name. -->
