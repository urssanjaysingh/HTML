<!-- The <dfn>...</dfn> element(or HTML Definition Element) allows you to specify that you are 
    introducing a special term. It's usage is similar to italic word in the midst of a paragraph.
Typically, you would use the <dfn> element the first time you introduce a key term. Most recent browsers
    render the content of a <dfn> element in an italic font. -->
