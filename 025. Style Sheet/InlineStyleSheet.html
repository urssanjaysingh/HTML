<!-- You can apply style sheet rules directly to any HTML element using style attribute of the 
relevant tag. This should be done only when you are interested to make a particular change 
in any HTML element only.
Rules defined inline with the element overrides the rules defined in an external CSS file as 
well as the rules defined in <style> element. -->
