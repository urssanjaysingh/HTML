<!-- Hidden form controls are used to hide data inside the page which later on can be pushed 
    to the server. This control hides inside the code and does not appear on the actual page. 
For example, following hidden form is being used to keep current page number. When a user will 
click next page then the value of hidden control will be sent to the web server and there 
it will decide which page will be displayed next based on the passed current page. -->
