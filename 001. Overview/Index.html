<!-- HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the most widely used language to write Web Pages. 
    >> Hypertext refers to the way in which Web Pages (HTML documents) are linked together. Thus, the link available on a webpage is called Hypertext. 
    >> As its name suggests, HTML is a Markup Language which means you use HTML to simply "mark-up" a text document with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure it to display.
    >> Tags are enclosed within angle braces <Tag Name>. Except few tags, most of the tags have their corresponding closing tags. i.e. </Tag Name> -->
