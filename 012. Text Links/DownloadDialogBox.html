<!-- Sometimes it is desired that you want to give an option where a user will click a link 
    and it will pop up a "File Download" box to the user instead of displaying actual content. 
    This is very easy and can be achieved using an HTTP header in your HTTP response.
For example, if you want make a Filename file downloadable from a given link then its 
syntax will be as follows. -->

#!/usr/bin/perl
# Additional HTTP Header
print "Content-Type:application/octet-stream; name=\"FileName\"\r\n";
print "Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"FileName\"\r\n\n";
# Open the target file and list down its content as follows
open( FILE, "<FileName" ); while(read(FILE, $buffer, 100)){ print("$buffer"); }
