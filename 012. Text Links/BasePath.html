<!-- When you link HTML documents related to the same website, 
    it is not required to give complete URL for every link.
You can get rid of it if you use <base> tag in your HTML document header. 
This tag is used to give a base path for all the links. 
So your browser will concatenate given relative path to this base path and will make a complete URL. -->

<!-- Following example makes use of <base> tag to specify base URL 
and later we can use relative path to all the links instead of giving complete URL for every link. -->
