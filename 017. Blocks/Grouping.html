<!-- All the HTML elements can be categorized into two categories 
1. Block Level Elements
    Block elements appear on the screen as if they have a line break before and after them.
    For example,  <p>, <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>, <ul>, <ol>, <dl>, <pre>, <hr />, 
        <blockquote>, and <address>
2. Inline Elements.
    Inline elements, on the other hand, can appear within sentences 
    and do not have to appear on a new line of their own. 
    The <b>, <i>, <u>, <em>, <strong>, <sup>, <sub>, <big>, <small>, <li>, <ins>, <del>, 
        <code>, <cite>, <dfn>, <kbd>, and <var> elements are all inline elements.
-->

<!-- There are two important tags which we use very frequently to group various other HTML tags - 
    1. <div> and 2. <span> tag. 

<div> tag can be used to create webpage layout where we define different parts(Left, Right, Top etc.) 
    of the page using <div> tag. This tag does not provide any visual change on the block 
        but this has more menaing when it is used with CSS.

The difference between the <span> tag and the <div> tag is that the <span> tag is used 
with inline elements whereas the <div> tag is used with block-level elements.
