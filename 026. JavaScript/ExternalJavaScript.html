<!-- A script is a small piece of program that can add interactivity to your website. For example, 
    a script could generate a pop-up alert box message, or provide a dropdown menu. 
This script could be written using JavaScript. You can keep JavaScript code in a separate file 
and then include it wherever it's needed, or you can define functionality inside HTML document itself. -->

<!-- If you are going to define a functionality which will be used in various HTML documents 
then it's better to keep that functionality in a separate JavaScript file and then include that 
file in your HTML documents. A JavaScript file will have extension as .js and it will be 
included in HTML files using <script> tag. -->
