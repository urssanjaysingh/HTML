<!-- Although most (if not all) browsers these days support JavaScript, but still some older 
browsers don't. If a browser doesn't support JavaScript, instead of running your script, it 
would display the code to the user. To prevent this, you can simply place HTML comments 
around the script as shown below -->

<!DOCTYPE html>

        <title>JavaScript</title>
        <script type="text/JavaScript">
            <!--
            document.write("Hello JavaScript!");
            //-->
