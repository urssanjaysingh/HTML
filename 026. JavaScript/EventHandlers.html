<!-- Event handlers are nothing but simply defined functions which can be called against any 
mouse or keyboard event. You can define your business logic inside your event handler 
which can vary from a single to 1000s of line code.
Let's write one simple functionEventHandler() in the header of the document. We will call 
this function when any user brings mouse over a paragraph. -->
