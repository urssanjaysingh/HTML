<!-- Horizontal lines <hr /> are used to visually break-up sections of a document.
>> This tag is an example of an empty element, 
where you do not need opening and closing tags, as there is nothing to go in between them.
>> This tag has a space between the characters br and the forward slash(/). 
If you omit this space, older browsers will have trouble rendering the line break, while,
If you miss the forward slash it is not valid in XHTML. -->
