<!-- The content of a <tt>...</tt> element is written in monospaced font.
Most of the fonts are known as variable-width fonts because different letters are of different widths,
For example, the letter 'm' is wider than the letter 'i'.
In a monospaced font, however, each letter has the same width. -->
