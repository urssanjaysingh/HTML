<!-- Here you simply put your image inside a hyper link and use ismap attribute
which makes it special image and when the user clicks some place within the image, the browser passes
the coordinates of the mouse pointer along with the URL specified in the <a> tag to the web server.
The server uses the mouse-pointer coordinates to determine which document to deliver back to the browser.
The href attribute must contain the URL of a server application like a cgi to process the 
incoming request based on the passed coordinates. -->
