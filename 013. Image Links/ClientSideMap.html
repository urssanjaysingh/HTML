<!-- Client side image maps are enabled by the usemap attribute of the <img /> tag and defined by
special <map> and <area> extension tags.
The image that is going to form the map is inserted into the page using the <img /> tag 
as a normal image, except it carries an extra attribute called usemap.
The <area> tag inside the map tag, specifies the shape and the coordinates to define the boundaries
of each clickable hotspot available on the image. -->

<!-- Coordinate System
rect = x1, y1, x2, y2
x1 and y1 are the coordinates of the upper left corner of the rectangle; 
x2 and y2 are the coordinates of the lower right corner.
circle = x0, y0, radius
x0 and y0 are the coordinates of the center of the circle, and radius is the circle's radius. A circle
centered at 200, 50 with a radius of 25 would have the attribute coords="200,50,25" -->
