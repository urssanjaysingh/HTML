<!-- Though you will learn using style sheets with HTML in a separate tutorial, but here you
must make a note that if you are using Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) in your HTML code
then it is recommended to put that style sheet code inside proper HTML comments so that
old browsers can work properly. -->
