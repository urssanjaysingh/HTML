<!-- Comment is a piece of code which is ignored by any web browser. 
It is a good practice to add comments into your HTML code, especially in complex documents, 
    to indicate sections  of a document, and any other notes to anyone looking at the code. 
Comments help you and others understand your code and increases code readability. -->
