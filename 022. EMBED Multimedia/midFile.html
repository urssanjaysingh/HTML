<!-- Sometimes you need to add music or video into your web page. The easiest way to add 
    video or sound to your web site is to include the special HTML tag called <embed>. 
    This tag causes the browser itself to include controls for the multimedia automatically 
    provided browser supports <embed> tag and given media type.
You can also include a <noembed> tag for the browsers which don't recognize the <embed> tag. 
    You could, for example, use <embed> to display a movie of your choice, and <noembed> to display 
        a single JPG image if browser does not support <embed> tag -->

<!-- Here is a simple example to play an embedded midi file: -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

    <head>
        <title>HTML Embed Tag</title>
    </head>

    <body>
        <embed src="UnderTheSea.mid" width="100%" height="60">
        <noembed><img src="pic.png" alt="Alternative Media"></noembed>
    </body>

</html>
